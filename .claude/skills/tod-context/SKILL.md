## Setting-specific spellings

- "Chrypt" replaces "Crypt"
- "Tohmb" replaces "Tomb"

Apply to all setting content.

## Deeper lore (read only if larger setting context is needed)

- `setting/Time-of-Dying.md`: Setting overview for the Time-of-Dying project.
- `setting/Folklore.md`: Random setting folklore. Good source when generating story ideas.
- `setting/Mythology.md`: Main setting summary. Maps setting details to specific myth categories.
- `setting/folklore/`: Detailed documents for confirmed folklore. Only reference if the user requests.
- `setting/mythology/`: Deep-dive expansions of mythology elements (cosmogony, cosmology, theogony, anthropogeny, magic systems).
- `setting/archive/`: Old or unused setting/story documents. Never access unless directed by the user.
